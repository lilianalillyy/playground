## Playground

This is my collection of small free-time projects/scripts that are not in a separate repository.

- [fixtriathlon](fixtriathlon) - bash script + udev event that disables M720 Triathlon's virtual keyboard
- [playlist-recreate](playlist-recreate) - utilizing Google's Document AI to recreate playlists from screenshots of a music app
- [github-repos](github-repos) - script utilizing GitHub's REST & GQL to private/delete/transfer repositories on my old account
